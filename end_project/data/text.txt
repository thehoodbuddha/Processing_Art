Lawrence Rainey was responsible for the conception of this volume as a whole. He 
has also been responsible for selecting translating and annotating the manifestos 
and theoretical writings in Part 1 of this volume. All the works in this section are 
given  in  their entiret with  no  editorial  omissions.  Christine  Poggi  was  respon-
sible for selecting the visual materials contained in Part 2 of this volume. Laura 
Wittman  was  responsible  for  selecting,  translating,  and  annotating  the  creative  
texts in Part 3 of this volume, with the exception of two that are credited to their 
respective  translators  immediately  following  the  author  and  title.  For  reasons  of  
length, some creative writings have been edited, and omissions are signaled by an 
ellipsis in square brackets [. . .].
The editors are grateful to Professors Walter Adamson and Jeffrey Schnapp for 
their insightful suggestions, which have greatly improved this work.
The editors regret that copyright considerations made it impossible to include 
a selection from Anton Giulio Bragaglia’s 
Futurist Photodynamism
 (1911). The most 
extensive translation of this work into English to date has been published in the 
journal 
Modernism/Modernity
 15, no. 2 (April 2008): 363–79
